How It Works

1. The homepage displays a hero banner with promotions.

2. Users can browse new arrivals and popular products.

3. Each product shows price, discount, and an "Add to Cart" button (non-functional demo).

4. Footer includes help sections, payment methods, and subscription form.

Note: This is a frontend-only project. No backend or real payments are integrated.
